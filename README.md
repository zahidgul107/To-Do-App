# To-Do-App
This is a To-Do App that allows you to manage your tasks. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple user interface and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The data is stored in the browser's local storage.

# Features
Add New Tasks: Click on the "Add New Tasks" button to open a modal form where you can enter the details of a new task.
Task Title: Enter the title of the task in the "Task Title" input field.
Due Date: Select the due date of the task using the "Due Date" input field.
Description: Enter a description of the task in the "Description" textarea.
Add: Click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.
Task List: The added tasks are displayed below the form. Each task includes the title, due date, and description.
Edit: Click on the edit button (represented by a pencil icon) to edit a task. The task details will be pre-filled in the form for editing.
Delete: Click on the delete button (represented by a trash can icon) to delete a task.
Local Storage: The task data is stored in the browser's local storage, allowing the tasks to persist even if the page is refreshed or closed.

# Usage
Clone the repository or download the files (index.html, style.css, main.js) to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Use the "Add New Tasks" button to add new tasks. Fill in the task details and click "Add" to add the task to the list.
Existing tasks are displayed below the form. You can edit or delete tasks as needed.
The task data is stored in the browser's local storage, so the tasks will be retained even if you close or refresh the page.

Note: This is a basic implementation of a To-Do App using JavaScript and local storage. It does not include advanced features like user authentication or server-side storage.
